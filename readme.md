# reStructuredText Language Server

Some day, I hope, here will be a repository of a reStructuredText language
server, written in Zig.

## Features planned

- [ ] `.. role` directives -> autocomplete `:role:` names
- [ ] autocomplete backticked content based on `:role:` content
- [ ] `.. directive` -> autocomplete directive names
- [ ] autocomplete directive title (`:: this part`)
- [ ] autocomplete directive fields if possible (choose `:class:`, `:delim:` for example)
- [ ] autocomplete |replacements| from those defined
